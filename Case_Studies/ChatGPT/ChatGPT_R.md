1. Client: ChatGPT UI (React + TypeScript)
React:

Why? React is a popular, performant frontend library that supports dynamic UI updates (critical for streaming responses). Its component-based architecture allows for modular development (e.g., chat bubbles, sidebar, settings).

Real-time updates: React efficiently handles WebSocket/SSE-driven streaming tokens.

TypeScript:

Why? Adds static typing to JavaScript, reducing bugs in a complex chat application with many stateful interactions (e.g., conversation history, model switching).

2. API Gateway / Frontend Proxy
Load Balancer (e.g., NGINX, AWS ALB):

Why? Distributes traffic across backend services to handle scale.

TLS Termination:

Why? Offloads encryption/decryption to the gateway, reducing backend overhead.

Auth0/OAuth2/JWT:

Why? Industry-standard authentication for secure user sessions. JWT enables stateless validation of user identity across services.

3. Session Management Service (PostgreSQL)
PostgreSQL:

Why? A relational database is ideal for structured conversation metadata (threads, token counts, user IDs). Supports ACID transactions for consistency.

Indexing: Fast lookup of conversation history by user/session ID.

Alternatives like DynamoDB could be used for scale but lack complex query flexibility.

4. Prompt Orchestration Layer
Dynamic Prompt Building:

Why? Combines system prompts, conversation history, and user input while respecting token limits (e.g., truncating oldest messages if needed).

Stop Tokens/Sampling Controls:

Why? Ensures the model stops generating text at logical boundaries (e.g., end of a sentence) and adheres to user preferences (e.g., creativity vs. determinism).

5. LLM Inference Service
vLLM/Triton/ONNX Runtime:

Why? High-performance inference engines for GPU-accelerated LLMs.

vLLM: Optimized for attention mechanisms, supports continuous batching (improves throughput).

Triton: NVIDIAâ€™s inference server, supports multi-framework models (PyTorch/TensorFlow).

ONNX/TensorRT: For model optimization and hardware acceleration.

WebSocket/SSE:

Why? Enables real-time token streaming to the client without polling.

6. Rate Limiting + Billing Service (Redis, Stripe)
Redis:

Why? In-memory store for fast quota checks (e.g., tokens used per user/minute). Lua scripts can enforce atomic rate-limiting logic.

Stripe:

Why? Handles subscription billing, invoicing, and metered usage (e.g., pay-per-token for API users).

7. Moderation & Safety Filter
ML Classifiers + Regex:

Why? Hybrid approach:

ML models (e.g., fine-tuned BERT) detect nuanced harmful content.

Regex blocks obvious patterns (e.g., credit card numbers).

Jailbreak Detection:

Why? Rule-based checks for known attack patterns (e.g., "ignore previous instructions").

8. Observability & Logging (Datadog, Prometheus, ELK)
Datadog/Prometheus:

Why? Monitor latency, errors, and throughput in real time (critical for SLA adherence).

ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana):

Why? Aggregates and searches logs (e.g., prompt/response pairs for debugging).

User Feedback Tracking:

Why? Thumbs up/down signals help improve model performance.

9. Model Selection & Routing
Routing Logic:

Why? Balances cost, latency, and capability:

GPT-3.5 for simple queries (cheaper/faster).

GPT-4 Turbo for complex reasoning.

GPT-4o for multimodal tasks.

vLLM/Triton Backend:

Why? Efficiently manages GPU resources across model variants.

ðŸ“Š Data Layer
Data Type	Technology	Reasoning
Conversation Logs	PostgreSQL/ClickHouse	PostgreSQL for ACID; ClickHouse for analytics (fast aggregation over logs).
Token Usage	Redis/DynamoDB	Redis for low-latency counters; DynamoDB for scalable KV storage.
File Uploads	AWS S3	Durable, cheap object storage for documents/images.
Real-time Queues	Kafka/Redis Streams	Kafka for high-throughput event streaming (e.g., async moderation).
ðŸ”’ Security & Privacy
End-to-End TLS:

Why? Encrypts data in transit (user â†” backend).

PII Redaction:

Why? Strips emails/phone numbers from logs to comply with GDPR.

Hashed User IDs:

Why? Allows analytics without exposing identities.

ðŸ§° Infrastructure
Cloud (AWS/Azure):

Why? Leverages managed services (e.g., Azure for OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4, AWS for global reach).

Kubernetes:

Why? Orchestrates scalable, fault-tolerant microservices.

Bazel:

Why? Fast, reproducible builds for large monorepos (common in ML infra).

Key Trade-offs & Reasoning
Stateless vs. Stateful:

The architecture is stateless at the LLM level (each request is independent) but stateful in the session layer (PostgreSQL stores context). This balances scalability with conversation continuity.

Real-time Streaming:

WebSocket/SSE avoids polling, reducing latency for incremental responses.

GPU Efficiency:

vLLM/Triton maximize GPU utilization via batching, reducing cost per token.

This design prioritizes scalability, real-time interaction, and cost control while maintaining security and observability.
