# 🧠 System Design with an AI Perspective

This repository explores modern system design through the **lens of AI**. It blends traditional software architecture with the emerging needs of **machine learning**, **LLMs**, **real-time inference**, and **intelligent automation**.

Whether you're designing microservices, distributed systems, or data pipelines, the focus here is how to **infuse AI into the core architecture**—securely, scalably, and responsibly.

## 📌 Key Focus Areas

- 🤖 **AI-first system design patterns**
- 🔁 **Designing for inference, retraining, and feedback loops**
- ⚙️ **MLOps and scalable model deployment**
- 🏗️ **Data infrastructure for AI applications**
- 🧩 **LLM integration into web, mobile, and backend services**
- 🔐 **Privacy, ethics, and cost-aware architecture**
- 📚 **Real-world case studies and reference architectures**
  - AI copilots
  - Recommendation engines
  - RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems

---

## 📁 File Naming Convention

Each system design example follows this consistent structure:

- `Component_A.md` → ✨ **Primary Approach**
- `Component_ALT.md` → 🔄 **Alternative Approach**
- `Component_R.md` → 🧠 **Reasoning, trade-offs, and decisions**

> Example:  
> - `ChatGPT_A.md` → Transformer-based architecture  
> - `ChatGPT_ALT.md` → Alternative pipelines or models  
> - `ChatGPT_R.md` → Reasoning for architectural choices

---

## 🚀 How to Use This Repo

1. Browse by system (e.g. ChatGPT, RAG, Recommenders)
2. Start with the **`_A.md`** file to understand the primary design
3. Explore **alternatives** and **rationale** in `ALT` and `R` files
4. Apply patterns to your own AI system designs

## 📄 Coming Soon

- RAG architecture (LLM + search)
- AI copilot architecture
- Vector DB + real-time recommendation systems
- Deployment blueprints with Kubernetes, SageMaker, and Ray
