ðŸ§  System Design with an AI Perspective
This repository explores modern system design through the lens of AI. It blends traditional software architecture with machine learning, LLM integration, real-time inference systems, and intelligent automation. Whether you're designing microservices, distributed systems, or data pipelines, this repo focuses on how to infuse AI into the core architectureâ€”securely, scalably, and responsibly.

ðŸ“Œ Key Focus Areas:

AI-first system design patterns

MLOps and scalable model deployment

Data infrastructure for AI systems

Designing for inference, retraining, and feedback loops

LLM integration into web, mobile, and backend services

Privacy, ethics, and cost-aware architecture

Real-world case studies and reference architectures (e.g. AI copilots, recommendation engines, RAG systems)
