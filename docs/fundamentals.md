# Fundamentals

Core concepts and principles for designing AI-integrated systems.

## Core Principles

1. **Data-Centric Design**: AI systems are only as good as their data
2. **Model Lifecycle Management**: Handling training, deployment, and updates
3. **Scalability**: Managing compute-intensive AI workloads
4. **Reliability**: Building robust systems around probabilistic AI outputs

## Architecture Patterns

- Microservices for AI
- Event-driven AI pipelines  
- Hybrid cloud deployments
- Edge AI considerations
